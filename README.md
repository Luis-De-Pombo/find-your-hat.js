# find-your-hat.js
find-your-hat.js is a terminal app single-player game that can be played using the Node runtime environment. The player must move around a board to find a randomly placed hat, while evading to fall over the board edge or into randomly placed traps.

This app uses the [prompt-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-sync) Node dependency to ask the user for new player positions.

## Usage
To start playing, open the repository/folder in your terminal and run the commands:
```
npm install
node main.js
```
Then follow the instructions at the terminal/prompt to move the player position.
